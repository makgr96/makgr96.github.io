            <h1>About Regions and Linguistics in English</h1>
            <p> To start let me clarify that this site will only discuss some very basic principles and definitions in the linguistic field and the main language studied will be English.
              A region in linguistic terms is essentially the same as regular terms, it refers to an area that has definable characteristics. In linguistics, their are six main regions:
              <ul>
                <li>The South</li>
                <li>The North</li>
                <li>The West</li>
                <li>The Midlands</li>
                <li>Mid-Atlantic</li>
                <li>New England</li>
              </ul>
              These five regions are not even close to the only regions, there are many regions within regions and much smaller dialect areas across the US.
              Many people use the word "accent" when referring to a regional dialect someone may have.
              Many characteristics make up a dialect, from vowel use to r-lessness (dropping your r's like saying cah instead of caR) linguists are very interested in every little detail.
              Below are some examples from each of these regions along with a some defining characteristics.

            (Audio of the South here)
            <ul>
              <li> ai monophthongization</li>
              <li>second person plural pronoun "y'all" for some</li>
              <li>Southern Vowel Shift</li>
              <li>/u/ and /o/ fronting</li>
              <li>Pin/Pen merger</li>
            </ul>
      (Audio of Midlands here)
      <ul>
        <li>R-ful (r is pronounced)</li>
        <li>Merry/marry distinction</li>
        <li>Cot/Caught merger</li>
      </ul>
      (Audio of West Here)
      <ul>
        <li>R-ful</li>
        <li>Merry/Marry distinction</li>
        <li>Cot/Caught Merger</li>
        <li>California Vowel Shift</li>
      </ul>
      (Audio of North Here)
      <ul>
        <li>Northern City Shift (for Inland North)</li>
        <li>Monophthongal /o/ and /e/ </li>
        <li>Canadian Raising</li>
      </ul>
      (Audio of Mid-Atlantic Here)
      <ul>
        <li>R-lessness and inserting "r" between vowels</li>
        <li>Caught/Cot distinction</li>
      </ul>
      (Audio of New England Here)
      <ul>
        <li>R-lessness and adding "r" between vowels</li>
        <li>Merry/Marry distinction</li>
        <li>Very similar to the North</li>
      </ul>
              </p>
    <p>
      There can also be great distinctions within a smaller area, like a state. For example, here is 4 audios with speakers all from the state of Virginia.
      One is from the southern part of the state, one from the northern part, one from the eastern portion, and one from western Virginia.
<ul>
      <li>North
      (Audio of Carter)</li>

      <li>South
      (Kymberly)</li>

      <li>East
      (Alexis)</li>

      <li>West
      (Gillian)</li>
    </ul>
